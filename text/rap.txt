Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all:
What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call—
All mine was thine before thou hadst this more.
Then if for my love thou my love receivest,
I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest;
But yet be blamed if thou this self deceivest
By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.
I do forgive thy robb’ry, gentle thief,
Although thou steal thee all my poverty;
And yet love knows it is a greater grief
To bear love’s wrong than hate’s known injury.
        Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,
        Kill me with spites, yet we must not be foes.
Columbine, roll a five
Baby shake that ass, shake that pumpkin pie

She call me daddy like grandmama baby
If this Sunday dinner, my hand on her gravy

An M is my minimum wage

Niggas be judging my moves, but please tell me, what have you done?

Don't acknowledge the shrimps when they ridicule

You ain't got enough heart, get a bigger pool
Wanna fight but he bigger, I ain't really trippin'

Fettuchini with Alfredo
All I wanted was the fame and every game they made on Sega
I was 5 or 6 years old when I had told myself ok you're special
But I treat you like my equal never lesser
I was 26 years old when we had dropped this one amazing record
Had the world stepping
That's what I call epic
Couple summers later I got paper
I acquired taste for salmon on a bagel
With the capers on a square plate
At the restaurant with the why you got to stare face
To know I either ball or I record over the snare and bass
Rapper face, dread headed
Golden diamond teeth wearing
They just mad 'cause I got that cheese bitch I keep dairy
Turnt up in the party getting lit to Yachty
With a Spanish Barbie word to my mami
In the middle of the party bitch get off me
In the cut I'm rolling up my broccoli

Make me think about all of the rappers I've been feeding on
Got a feeling that's the same dudes that we speakin' on, oh word?
You ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin' on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a fucking read-along
Ain't a fucking sing-along 'less you brought the weed along
Then ju' (okay, I got it) then just drop down and get your eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put The Beatles on
All that shit you talkin' 'bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know, then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head, then mothafucka' get to bustin'
Yes Lord, I don't really say this often 
But this long dick nigga ain't for the long talkin', I beast
I love bad bitches that's my fuckin' problem (problem)
And yeah, I like to fuck I got a fuckin' problem (true)
I love bad bitches that's my fuckin' problem (problem)
And yeah, I like to fuck I got a fuckin' problem (true)
I love bad bitches that's my fuckin' problem (problem)
And yeah, I like to fuck I got a fuckin' problem (true)
If findin' somebody real is your fuckin' problem
Bring your girls to the crib maybe we can solve it
Uh, yeah, hoe this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she's from the hood but she live inside in the Valley now
Vacate in Atlanta, then she going back to Cali, mmm
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyein' me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar, mmm
A.K.A. Benz is to me is just a car, mmm
That mean your friends need to be up to par
See my standards are papered by threesomes tomorrow, mmm
Kill 'em all dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holla back I'll do ya, beast
I love bad bitches that's my fuckin' problem (problem)
And yeah, I like to fuck I got a fuckin' problem (true)
I love bad bitches that's my fuckin' problem (problem)
And yeah, I like to fuck I got a fuckin' problem (true)
I love bad bitches that's my fuckin' problem (problem)
And yeah, I like to fuck I got a fuckin' problem (true)
If findin' somebody real is your fuckin' problem
Bring your girls to the crib maybe we can solve it, ay


They say Lil" Nahmir where you been at? I'm just passin' a breeze
I been runnin' up a check, that's why these bitches on me
I been coolin', layin' low, but I'm not takin' a seat
But just know a nigga back and this time I won't leave
I been runnin', runnin', runnin', gotta check me a bag
I got hunnids on my neck and I got Trues on my ass
Niggas said I'm goin' broke, well I just take it and laugh
I be speedin' in that foreign with Five-O on my ass
But I'm that nigga, I won't ever change, rubbin' off the paint
Smokin' dank, got a Uzi in my lap, I let it bang
Free Lil' Tay, know he keep a 'K, but he not Tay-K
I up the chop and let it blow him, watch this bitch heat his face, I'm that nigga
And all my young niggas pullin' triggers, we gorillas
We let this bitch off until you feel us, for you niggas
That's always on IG with them yiggies, takin' pictures
Is you really gon' use 'em or you just loafin' for them bitches?
You niggas really hoes and you be acting like these bitches
You niggas say y'all silent but y'all probably in there snitchin'
Most the niggas that's around me throwin C's like they crippin'
But they do it for the twins, free Lil' Corey and Lil' Christian
But I'm rockin' with my shooters and that's mandatory
One up top like I'm Mozzy, bitch I keep a forty
You say I'm lackin', nigga try me, shoot you and yo' shorty
I'm cookin up in the lab like I'm Rick and Morty
Forty poppa, hit a mobsta, turn your brain to pasta
Hit a opp up, dreads swangin' just like I'm a Rasta
Smokin' ganja and I'm zooted, walkin' in my Pradas
Any nigga test my gangsta nigga, I'ma pop 'em
And we ain't throwin' hands with you fuck niggas
It's one up top up in that chamber, better duck nigga
Niggas dissin' on Lil' Valley, he get slumped nigga
We shoot his body then we lay him in that trunk nigga
I'm one-hundo, bitch that's on my life, I will never fold
A nigga speakin on Lil' Quay, well then that nigga gotta go
I'm really small but I can fight but I'ma still up that pole
For you niggas think I'm pussy, you gon' have to show me hoe
Police always at my fuckin' crib, I don't tell 'em shit
I'm really rapping 'bout this fuckin life, that I fuckin' live
But I be coolin', tryna focus on them fuckin' dividends
But if it's money near yo' head, well I'ma fuckin get it, man
Where the bricks, where the bows?
1-7-double-O, slither gang, bloody nose
RIP Phillip, that's my right hand nigga but he gone, yeah
Now I gotta smoke these pussy niggas on my own 
These niggas actin' tough but turn pussy over a hoe 
Boy, I would never go, I dick that ho, then make her go 
Bitch, while I call your Uber, go wait over by the door 
And bitch, check on your phone, wait 'til you leave to turn it on 
That nigga talkin' tough, yes, I can hear it in his tone 
I slapped him with the chrome, then put a bullet in his dome 
My all white Air Force 1's gotta be fresh or I can't rock 'em 
If he step on these, I might just fuck around and sock him 
Dangle that boy over a ledge and then I drop him 
Shoot a bullet straight through his head, I solved the problem 
Not going back and forth on the 'Gram, I had to block him 
Rather catch him lackin' in public and then pop him 
Caught him on the elevator, had to 2Pac him 
I'ma pull a Biggie Smalls, nigga don't know who shot him
If I shoot and I miss, I bet one of my guys got him
And I'ma let him keep his shit 'cause I'm rich, I ain't gotta rob him
Where the bricks, where the bows?
1-7-double-O, slither gang, bloody nose
RIP Phillip, that's my right hand nigga but he gone, yeah
Now I gotta smoke these pussy niggas on my own 
These niggas actin' tough but turn pussy over a hoe 
Boy, I would never go, I dick that ho, then make her go 
Bitch, while I call your Uber, go wait over by the door 
And bitch, check on your phone, wait 'til you leave to turn it on 
Where the bricks, where the bows?
1-7-double-O, slither gang, bloody nose
RIP Phillip, that's my right hand nigga but he gone, yeah
Now I gotta smoke these pussy niggas on my own
These niggas actin' tough but turn pussy over a hoe 
Boy, I would never go, I dick that ho, then make her go 
Bitch, while I call your Uber, go wait over by the door e
And bitch, check on your phone, wait 'til you leave to turn it on 
I got a bag, ooh, ice on my wrist
Mama like, "Where you get this?"
I got a sad boo, gave her a brick
Then I gave her a lil kiss, ooh
Yeah, I rock out in the 6, 6
But nigga, we fire, we split
I'm takin' your shit, you college kid, ooh
We really be poppin' shit, ooh
I hit a lick, no kid, ooh
I had a lick but no bit, ooh

He do that talk and he simp, ooh
Damn that lil got a lil thick, ooh
I told that bitch to come in

All of these bitches, they mad, ooh

All of these niggas, they mad, ooh
I walk in the bank and I laugh, ooh

Walk in the buildin', I flex on that boy

Ice on my neck and my mama like, 
"Boy, where you get all of that cash?"
